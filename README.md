# decimal_book

This came from a tweet or a tumblr post or reddit idk something. 
The idea is that if you assign each letter, punctuation, and number its own value (i.e. 001, 002, 003), you could turn an entire book into a decimal. Becuase this decimal will be a rational number, it can be converted into a fraction, and therefore you will have a simple fraction representing an entire book.

Considering you much less space it takes to store a fraction than the entire text, as long as you have the "key" to what is essentially a cryptographic cipher, you could easily turn it back into text

I called it decimal_book but I really meant fraction_book. I'm not changing it, you get the idea

- optimize: I did not write any of this code with optimization in mind. I wrote it on a plane to germany, and then finished it while deliriously waiting until a reasonable time to fall asleep so I could wake up at 5am to go to the gym with my brother the next day. I imagine for very long texts this will be INCREDIBLY slow, both from text -> fraction and vice versa
